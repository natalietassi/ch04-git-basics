# Exercise 2

Learn the basics of git workflow, including adding new files.

1. **Fork** the repo onto your own github account  
(maybe you already did it).

2. clone it to your laptop  
`git clone ...`

3. Download an image from the web and place it into the repo folder
   into _exercise-2_ subfolder.
   
4. Add this file to _git_.  See [Adding
   Files](file:///home/otoomet/tyyq/teaching/info201/book/localbook/build/git-basics.html#adding-files). 

5. Add the image to this file using markdown syntax.
   
5. Write a paragraph of text where you explaine what the picture is
   about.  Feel free to add more.

4. commit your changes:  
`git commit -am "<explain what did you do>"`

5. send your edits back to GitHub
`git push`

6. check the repo on your github account.  Did it work?

[This is a photo of Dubs the Husky](DubsPic)

This photo is of Dubs II, the new University of Washington husky mascot. Unfortunately, Dubs recently passed away, but Dubs II is ready to step in as the new face of UW. In this photo, Dubs II is wearing a purple paw bandana around his neck, symbolizing his support for the University of Washington. The photo was taken in the University of Washington stadium on top of the football field.
